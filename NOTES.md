# Notes

## Summary (2026-10-24, after step 69)

Milestone O (steps 64–69, the review's trim findings T1–T16) is done: one commit per step on `main`, all pushed. `make test` passes (Go with `-race` too). The app was tried by hand after steps 64, 66 and 67 with the dev daemon and app on `NUSHI_DATA` (a `/tmp` link to the scratchpad), the fake agent in place of Claude (no Claude process ran), `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` in the scratchpad, a throwaway repository; dark theme, 1280×800; the test shell ran only `printf`. The installed Nushi and its daemon were left alone. `make install` put the build in `~/Applications/Nushi.app` (and the iCloud copy).

**Size**: the daemon went from 6,725 to 6,913 lines of Go (the `Dialect` and the facts the daemon now decides for the app: rewindable, scratch, subagent state, Other fields, category kinds, the default model), the ACP client stays 867, the app went from 12,506 to 12,431 lines of Dart, packages 682. No file is over 400 lines.

**Every finding**
- T1 done (64): no per-feature gating; an app newer than its daemon shows only a "Restart daemon" screen; the daemon's code for apps before API 23 and the `(API n)` tags are gone; dropped fields `reserved`; [ADR 0004](docs/adr/0004-connect-over-unix-socket.md) amended. T2 done: `RemoveChat` is gone (the e2e test deletes instead). T3 kept, as asked. T4 done: `/context` runs only in a throwaway fork. T5 done.
- T6 done (65): Claude's rules are in `internal/claude` (with `claudehistory`, `claudemcp`, `claudetrust`); `features/chats` takes a `Dialect` that `main` fills; the API calls no Claude package ([ADR 0025](docs/adr/0025-claude-rules-in-one-place.md)). T9 done: terminals follow the hub's chat events (archived or deleted closes them); `PlanDeleteChat` still lists the running terminals from the API, as composition. T10: the cheaper way, the `mcp` package says it's Claude-only. T13 done: one helper each for `session/new` and `session/fork`, one folder check (`chats.CheckFolder`).
- T7 done (66): the daemon sends whether a user message is rewindable, whether a chat's folder is a scratch folder, a subagent's state, times and result (and which call is its report), which form field is another's "Other", a context category's kind, which model is the default, and whether the context can be asked; the MCP form refuses a leading `-`. API 38. T8 done: the app names the agent from `Chat.agent` (`ChatState.agentName`).
- T11, T12, T14 done (67): one loader for a chat's changes, one tool-kind table, one collapsible card, chevron, inline edit, recent-folders menu and syntax color table; `chat_header.dart`, `question_parts.dart`, `inline_edit.dart`, `fake_test.go` split out.
- T15 done (68): the missing tests, the stale follower test fixed; the usage test was redone in step 66 (Claude's format is tested in `internal/claude`).
- T16 done (69): these notes, from 22,900 words to about a quarter; settled decisions went into [ADR 0026](docs/adr/0026-the-transcript-lays-out-every-item.md) and [ADR 0027](docs/adr/0027-what-lives-only-in-memory.md), or went.

**"Claude" left in the app**, where it is Claude-only: the MCP views (Claude's config, Claude's scopes), the trust card (Claude's trust record), and `claude --resume` in the Delete dialog (Claude's CLI).

**Changes to earlier behavior**
- An agent that can't fork gets no context breakdown (it had a refresh button in its own session).
- A background subagent counts as running only if the daemon saw it start (not, as before, while the turn runs or once it has steps): a replayed one reads as done, as before.
- A second click on a terminal tab renames it without showing the tab again (that handed the keyboard back to the shell). A rename saves on a click outside the box, for chats too.
- Hints: "Your reply", "Your comment" (were "… Claude").
- A deleted or archived chat's terminals close just after the call returns, not before.

**Not tried by hand**
- Anything with real Claude: subagent state and times, the Other pairing, the default model, context kinds and `/context` (the fake agent has none of these; they're covered by tests).
- A terminal tab rename with a real double-click (synthetic clicks don't reach the tab in either the old or the new build), the light theme, MCP add and edit.

**Needs your attention**
- My new app test (step 68) wrote the app's settings into your real data folder before I made tests use a temporary one: `~/Library/Application Support/Nushi/app.json` now holds the defaults, so the installed app forgets its collapsed cards, card order, pane widths, worktree choices, Changes scopes and open terminal panels. There was no backup to restore. Tests can't do that any more (`FLUTTER_TEST` picks a temporary data folder).
- The API went from 37 to 38: press "Restart daemon" in the installed app (it now shows only that until you do).

**Dependencies**: none added.

**Left behind by the testing**: nothing (the dev data folder and its `/tmp` link, the throwaway repository, the fake-agent shim, the dev client and UI helper removed).

## Line counts

Hand-written, without tests or generated code (`make lines`). Go is split into the daemon (`cmd`, `internal`) and the generic ACP client (`acp`, its type generator included, its fake test agent not). Packages are counted apart from the app.

Steps over the ~500-line tripwire (code and tests, without generated code): 1 (533, the socket transport), 2 (1,502, the whole ACP client and its type generator), 5 (739, the question card), 6 (639, config options), 8 (537, the fake agent and the e2e test the step asked for), 10, 11 (1,249, the POC's look), 12, 18, 19, 29, 30, 45 (580, review comments), 47 (560, the queue), 52, 53, 54, 55 (880, terminals in the daemon), 56 (1,100, the terminal panel), 60 (720, trust). Step 33 and this milestone removed more than they added.

## Agent facts (claude-agent-acp 0.94.0, Claude Code 2.1.308–309)

What the code depends on, and how the adapter behaves. Everything Nushi does about it is in `internal/claude*`.

**Sessions**
- `session/new` requires `mcpServers`: send `[]`, never `null`. Claude starts a session in the mode its settings say; it reports modes both as legacy `modes` and as a `mode` config option (Nushi shows only the option). Config options: `mode` (Manual, Accept edits, Plan, Auto, Bypass permissions), `model` (Default, Opus 5.5, Fable 5.1, Sonnet 5.5, Haiku 5.5), `effort` (category `thought_level`), `fast` (category `model_config`, a select), `agent` (no category). `set_config_option` answers with the full set.
- Claude names a session itself soon after the first prompt (`session_info_update`); until then Nushi uses the prompt's first line. A fork is titled "<title> (fork)", a fork of a fork "(fork) (fork)": ignored, so a moved or rewound chat keeps its title. Asking `/context` before the first message makes Claude name the chat after it, so it isn't asked then.
- Claude keeps a session on disk only once it has a message: `session/load` of an empty one fails, and Nushi then starts a new one. `session/load` replays the user's and agent's messages and the tool calls (final status and output, `messageId`s included), not permission prompts or questions; a cancelled turn replays as "[Request interrupted by user]". It sends no `usage_update`. Loading takes under a second once npx has the adapter.
- Claude's history folder for a session is named after its cwd: the real path (symlinks resolved, `/tmp` is `/private/tmp`), NFC, every UTF-16 unit that isn't an ASCII letter or digit replaced by `-`; past 200 characters cut, with a base-36 hash of the path. `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` moves the projects folder.
- `sessionCapabilities`: `fork`, `close`, `resume`, `list`, `delete`. `session/fork` copies the transcript into a new session on the same process (updates come tagged with the fork's id); with another `cwd` it fails, since it looks for the source only in the new folder's history, so a move copies the transcript there first ([ADR 0014](docs/adr/0014-moving-a-chat-forks-it.md)). After a fork the reported cost starts again near zero.
- Forking at a message: `_meta.jetbrains.air.fork = {version: 1, messageId}` on `session/fork` keeps the conversation up to that agent message, it included, for any client, after `session/load` too ([ADR 0020](docs/adr/0020-rewind-through-a-vendor-fork.md)). The adapter is recognized by `agentInfo.name` `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`.
- `session/delete` (for clients that aren't AIR, which get archiving) deletes `<id>.jsonl` and `<id>/` in whichever project folder has them, succeeds for a session never written, and leaves the history folder behind. Deleting a session the process has open, or closing it, makes Claude write a ~700-byte stub back as it ends; a second delete a few seconds later removes it. So side chats ended other than by closing them are deleted by a fresh agent once the one they ran on has stopped.

**Updates**
- Every `agent_message_chunk` has a `messageId`; chunks group by it. Claude sends no `agent_thought_chunk`s here (thinking is "omitted" for recent models).
- A tool call arrives as a `tool_call` with a generic title and empty `rawInput`, then `tool_call_update`s with the real title, `locations` and content; each update's content replaces the last. A command's first content is its description, the last its output in a fence; a failed command's output starts with `Exit code N`. An `Edit`'s diff holds the snippet, not the file. One update carries only `_meta.claudeCode.toolResponse`. Claude searches and lists with `Bash`, not Grep and Glob.
- Plans (`plan` updates, the full list each time) come only when Claude's todo tools are on (`CLAUDE_CODE_ENABLE_TODO_TOOLS=1` in its environment); Nushi doesn't set it.
- `available_commands_update` (about 80 commands, plugins' and skills' too) comes after `session/new` and `session/load`. A command is an ordinary prompt starting with `/name`; a `resource_link` to a `file://` URI makes Claude read the file.
- Usage: each turn ends with two `usage_update`s, `{used, size}` and the same with `cost` (USD, the session's so far; not reliable across processes). One carried `_meta._claude/rateLimit`. The prompt result's unstable `usage` sums the turn's model calls.
- `session/cancel` ends the turn in a second or two with `cancelled`; streamed text stays. A command Claude ran in the background can finish later and Claude writes on its own, outside any turn.
- Permissions: in Manual mode Claude asks with "Yes" (`allow_once`) and "No" (`reject_once`); the request names the tool call sent just before. `.claude/settings.json` = `{"permissions":{"defaultMode":"default"}}` starts a folder in Manual mode, for testing.
- Questions (AskUserQuestion) need `elicitation.form` in the client capabilities: a `tool_call` ("Asking for your input"), then `elicitation/create` in form mode tied to it. Each question is `question_N`, a `string` with `oneOf` or an `array` with `items.anyOf`, followed by an optional free-text `question_N_custom` titled "Other"; nothing is `required`, and the properties must be read in wire order. An empty accept reads to Claude as "no answer".
- Subagents: with `_meta: {"subagent-transcript": true}` in `initialize`'s client capabilities, a subagent's tool calls, text and thinking all carry `_meta.claudeCode.parentToolUseId` (tool calls also `toolName`); the Agent call's `subagent_type` is in its `rawInput`, maybe in a later update. Background subagents: the Agent call completes at once with "Async agent launched…", and the subagent ends with a `SubagentHandback` call whose `rawInput.message` is its report (its own output is only an acknowledgement). After `session/load` the Agent calls come back, but not a background subagent's steps or report. `async_task_*` updates go only to AIR clients; the ACP subagents RFD form (child sessions) only to clients that advertise `subagents` (see Later ideas).
- Steering: `initialize`'s `_meta.steering.supported` advertises `_session/steering`, answered `injected` while a turn runs or `promptRequired` (doing nothing). An injected message pre-empts the model and moves a foreground tool to the background, so Nushi steers right after a tool call ends; the running prompt ends once the steered messages are answered; the adapter echoes nothing.
- `/context` is answered by the adapter itself (no model call, no cost), as agent text, twice (two message ids, the same markdown): "Context Usage", then an "Estimated usage by category" table (System prompt, System tools, MCP tools, MCP server instructions, MCP tools (deferred), System tools (deferred), Custom agents, Memory files, Skills, Messages, Free space, Autocompact buffer; counts like `2.5k`, `934.6k`), then more tables. Claude keeps the answer in the conversation (5–7k tokens each time), so it runs in a throwaway fork (about 1.3 s; same numbers within 0.2k). It isn't replayed.
- The adapter logs progress on stderr; nushid copies it into its log.

**MCP config (Claude Code 2.1.309)**
- User scope: `mcpServers` in `~/.claude.json` (or `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR/.claude.json`, whose credentials go to a keychain item of their own). Local scope: `projects[<project>].mcpServers` in the same file, the project being the repository (its main checkout for a worktree) or the folder outside git. Project scope: `.mcp.json` in the folder or any folder above it.
- `claude mcp list` (no JSON form): "Checking MCP server health…", then `<name>: <command or URL> - <status>` per server (`✔ Connected`, `! Needs authentication`, `✘ Failed to connect — why`, `⏸ Pending approval`, `⊘ Disabled for this project`); remote URLs end ` (HTTP)`/` (SSE)`, connectors are `claude.ai <name>`, plugins' servers `plugin:<plugin>:<server>`. It starts every server; about a second. Stored configs (and `claude mcp get`) hold env and header values in clear.
- `claude mcp add-json` checks the name (letters, digits, `-`, `_`) and refuses an existing name or an unreadable config, exit 1; `remove` of a missing name too; both take `--`. `claude mcp login` needs a terminal on stdin (`script -q /dev/null` gives one), opens the browser and waits; `logout` fails for a server without OAuth.
- Approvals: `enabledMcpjsonServers` in an untracked `.claude/settings.local.json` counts only in a folder trusted in the terminal (`hasTrustDialogAccepted`); `disabledMcpjsonServers` (any settings file) rejects a server everywhere and `claude mcp list` leaves it out. `disabledMcpServers` in a settings file does nothing. The local settings file is at the repository's root.
- A chat loads its MCP servers when its session starts or loads and keeps them; it loads a "Pending approval" `.mcp.json` server without asking. MCP tools are deferred.

## Decisions to revisit

Open questions; what's settled is in `docs/adr/` or in the code.

- New in O: the daemon decides a background subagent ran only if it saw it start; times are the daemon's clock, so they survive an app restart but not a daemon restart. The default model is "Default…" by name (Claude's), and an "Other" field is `<id>_custom` (Claude's).
- New in O: the app tells an older daemon only "Restart daemon"; nothing degrades gracefully any more (ADR 0004). A daemon newer than the app keeps working.
- Diffs: a side over 10,000 lines isn't diffed; over 20,000 characters is computed in an isolate; a side over 200,000 characters isn't highlighted; the daemon skips files over 1 MB a side.
- Markdown is healed and reparsed whole on each streamed chunk: fine for replies of a few thousand words.
- Copying a selection across blocks (paragraph, code, table) loses the line breaks between them (Flutter's `SelectionArea`).
- MCP masking is a display heuristic: a secret in a shape it doesn't recognize shows. Editing a server with hidden values works only if the config is otherwise unchanged; else they must be typed again.
- The trust card is advice the daemon doesn't enforce ([ADR 0023](docs/adr/0023-warn-before-a-folder-runs-code.md)); the token stays readable by the agent ([ADR 0024](docs/adr/0024-the-agent-can-read-the-token.md)).
- Modes have no warning styling: the adapter doesn't tag Bypass permissions, and naming it would be a per-agent table.
- Review comments are the app's (`reviews.json`), not the daemon's: they don't follow a chat to another Mac.
- A message sent while a chat reopens, rewinds or moves waits in the queue rather than being refused.
- Whether the agent can delete its history is learned by starting it once per daemon run, the first time a Delete dialog opens.
- Terminals: Option is always Meta; ⌘-click opens a path relative to where the terminal started, not the shell's current folder; ⌘K clears only the emulator.
- Drops onto the chat (`desktop_drop`) were never tried by hand.

## Later ideas

- Show the plan's usage limits (session and weekly) for subscription users, if the agent exposes them. ACP doesn't today; claude-agent-acp 0.94.0 did put a `_meta._claude/rateLimit` (five-hour and seven-day utilization) on one `usage_update` (see ACP quirks), which isn't a stable interface.
- Plain model chat with no agent (no tools, no folder) straight to an API or gateway with a key. Nushi would then own the history and model settings. For agent chats a gateway or key already works through Claude's own settings (`ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `apiKeyHelper` in `~/.claude/settings.json`).
- Open a session started outside Nushi (e.g. `claude` in a terminal) as a chat: list the agent's sessions per folder through ACP `session/list` (claude-agent-acp 0.94.0 has it, under `sessionCapabilities`), pick one, and `session/load` it. No copy: the agent's history stays the source. Mind a session that's still open in a terminal (two writers to one transcript).

- Git actions from the Changes view: stage and unstage files or hunks, commit with a message, maybe push. It's read-only toward git for now ([ADR 0019](docs/adr/0019-changes-read-only-toward-git.md)); doing it would mean revisiting that ADR (git writes next to an agent that may be writing too).
- Subagents as ACP child sessions (the RFD form claude-agent-acp offers a client that advertises `subagents`): a background subagent's steps after a daemon restart, and a stop button per subagent. See step 51.

## Dependencies

- Go: `connectrpc.com/connect` v1, `google.golang.org/protobuf`, buf through `go run` (codegen), `github.com/creack/pty`, `golang.org/x/sys/unix`.
- Dart: `connectrpc` (with `http2` 2.x: 2.0.1 doesn't resolve with 3.x), `protobuf`, `flutter_markdown_plus`, `markdown`, `re_highlight`, `url_launcher`, `file_selector`, `pasteboard`, `desktop_drop`, `xterm2` (MIT; brings `xterm2_core`, `zmodem`, `quiver`, `equatable`, `convert`); fonts IBM Plex Sans and JetBrains Mono (OFL), bundled.

## Security notes to look at

- Agents run as you, through `npx --yes @agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@0.94.0` (pinned by version, not hash), started in the daemon's data folder so a project's `node_modules` or `.npmrc` can't swap it. A chat's folder reaches the agent only as `cwd`.
- A panic on something the agent sent becomes a JSON-RPC error; a malformed form is refused.
- `ListFiles` lists any absolute folder a client names (names, 20,000 at most); mentioned files go to the agent as `file://` links.
- Git runs as you in the folder a client names: `core.fsmonitor` off, `--no-ext-diff`/`--no-textconv`, hooks off (`core.hooksPath=/dev/null`), the panel's status without the repository's own filter drivers; Changes and new worktrees still run them (git-crypt, lfs). Names starting with `-` are refused as bases and commits. Worktree removal and `branch -D` force only when the request says so, which the app sends only after showing what would be lost; the daemon checks again.
- Agent markdown: local images only from regular files of 20 MB at most, remote ones after a click; links open http(s) only, in the browser.
- Moving a chat writes a copy of the transcript (0600) into Claude's projects folder for the fork, then removes it; never replaces one there.
- MCP: Claude's config holds secrets in clear; the daemon masks them before they leave it. It runs `claude mcp add-json/remove/login/logout` (names checked, `--`), so a client can add a server Claude runs as you, as a prompt could. The on/off switch writes the project's `.claude/settings.local.json` (its two MCP lists only, atomically, keeping its mode) and may add it to `.git/info/exclude`.
- Terminals: any client with the token can open a shell as you anywhere; they must stay off remote access ([ADR 0022](docs/adr/0022-the-daemon-owns-terminals.md)). Closing kills what has the terminal as its controlling terminal.
- Trust reads `~/.claude.json`, never writes it; "Start anyway" goes to Nushi's `trusted.json`.
- The token (0600, made again if empty or short) sits beside the socket in a 0700 folder; anything running as you, the agent included, can read it.

## Working notes

- Screenshots of the app window are current only while it's in front: macOS stops Flutter drawing an occluded window.
- To watch the fake agent in the app: build `acp/acptest/fakeagent`, put an `npx` that execs it first on `PATH`, and start a daemon with that `PATH` and `NUSHI_DATA` (a short path: the socket path has a length limit). Its scripts answer prompt words: `permission`, `question`, `think`, `pwd`, `many`, `plan`.
- App tests get a data folder in the temporary folder (`FLUTTER_TEST`); never point them at the real one.
